## What we’ve done

- Undertaken internal engagement to inform selection of an appropriate design system / UI component kit. We:
  - Explored prevailing accessibility standards, discussed ways in which the concept of progressive enhancement could apply to the PROCAT Evolution UI, and evaluated how the GOV.UK design system could underpin some aspects of the new UI
  - Reviewed the framework that is being rolled out for use on project ETNA, with a view to how it could potentially be implemented on Omega
- Completed ‘as is’ interviews & demos of existing systems
- Completed high level ‘as is’ service diagrams and detailed end-to-end process flows to give us an in-depth understanding of all the steps in key processes such as accession

## What we’ve learned

- Understood the ways in which the PROCAT Evolution UI will need to adhere to TNA’s approach to accessibility
- We learned about the underlying UI framework for ETNA
- Developed our knowledge of as-is PROCAT Editorial platform’s problems and observed the end-to-end flows through the system.
- We’ve begun to explore how linked data could be reflected in end-user-facing functionality, and learned about the opportunities which exist to redesign the underlying processes and flows modelled by as-is PROCAT.

## What’s next

- Continue ‘as is’ activities, focussing now on the ‘long tail’
- Explore the existing ETNA UI to identify scope for component reuse
- Prioritise screens and begin wireframing
- Explore -
  - Approaches for mapping content
  - Developing high-level ideas to test
  - Planning a test regime / approach
